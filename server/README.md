Movie finder data.

In this project, i used the Express framework to build a server that can talk to another server and cache the results.The web server will respond to GET requests for http://localhost:3000/ and return the data from the API.

However when making a second request to the same endpoint the server should not return data from the same API, but instead from some object or array.
